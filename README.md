LandS
=====

LandS is a game I made for the SFML 72h Game Jam #1 (2013-08-04). You must escape from a giant mannor avoiding ghosts attacks. Get your slime gun ready !

The purpose was to create a game, including arts, in 72h. 

It's C++ and, well, uses SFML. It uses Lua and TinyML too.

Do not take that code to learn, the goal wasn't to do the cleaner code but to have a working game !
